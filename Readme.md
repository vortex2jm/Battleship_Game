### Hello! This is a battleship game code to run on linux command line!

#### Bellow we have steps to play the game!

 - First step:  Download .C file and compile on your machine -> *"gcc -o prog battleship.c -lm"*

 - Second step: Create a directory with any name and inside this directory create another directory as *"saida"*. Prog have to be outside these directories.

   Ex:

 *"principal directory"*.
 ._
 .   *"(chosen name)"*.
 ._  .
 .   .      *"saida"*.
 ._   .
 .   *"battleship.c"*.
 .   *"prog"*.


 - Third step: Now you have to execute the program. The command is *"./prog (chosen name)"*

 - Fourth step: If you followed all steps correctly, the game will be running on your linux command line.

 - Fifth step: To play the game you have to enter player1 and player2 names and then, start to choose board positions. First character is a letter and second is a number. Letters can be from *A* to *J* and numbers can be from *1* to *10*. Example: *b8* is a play.


#### Comments

 - OBS: The game language's in portuguese.

 - OBS2: After the end of game, you will have statistics in *"saida"*(dir).

 - OBS3: The directory *"game"* can be renamed, but *"saida"* can't. If you rename *"saida"*, you have to compile file again and run program with *"./prog <chosen name>"*

 - OBS4: This program was my first university work in C language. It's very simple and doesn't has a lot of advanced concepts, but was very important to my learning.
